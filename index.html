                    I'm a <strong>Computer Science student</strong> focused on Web Development in Front-End track, in my
                    journey to be a developer

                <p>
                    During my life, I participated in many activities that honed my skills. In the period from 2018 to
                    2021, I learned the skills of graphic design and video editing, and I worked with them in the
                    neighborhood committee to document the activities. In 2021 I participated in an entrepreneurship
                    training program and obtained second place among the participants, and the idea Which I presented
                    was funded, and we developed samples of it and put it on the local market. During the year 2022, I
                    started learning programming and I loved the field, so after I finished high school in the same
                    year, I joined the computer science major at Al-Azhar University Of Gaza.

        <h2 class="program-title">Why I'm applying for this program?</h2>

        <div class="program-content">
            <p>I'm applying for the Code2Career Training Program because I truly want to take the next step in my
                journey as a developer. I’ve been learning and practicing on my own, but I feel ready to be part of
                something more structured—something that will help me grow not just technically, but also
                professionally.
                <br>
                <br>
                What really drew me to this program is how it focuses on real-world experience and teamwork. I learn
                best when I'm working with others, building things that have purpose, and getting feedback along the
                way. Being surrounded by people who are also passionate about tech is something I’m really looking
                forward to.
                <br>
                <br>
                I know there’s still a lot for me to learn, but I’m motivated and ready to put in the effort. I see this
                as a chance to gain the kind of experience that will help me feel confident stepping into the tech
                industry and building a meaningful career.
